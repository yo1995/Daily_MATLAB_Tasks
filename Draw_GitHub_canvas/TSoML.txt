All of us have read thrilling stories in which the hero had only a limited and specified time to live Sometimes it was as long as a year sometimes as short as twentyfour hours But always we were interested in discovering just how the doomed man chose to spend his last days or his last hours I speak of course of free men who have a choice not condemned criminals whose sphere of activities is strictly delimited 

Such stories set us thinking wondering what we should do under similar circumstances What events what experiences what associations should we crowd into those last hours as mortal beings What happiness should we find in reviewing the past what regrets 

Sometimes I have thought it would be an excellent rule to live each day as if we should die tomorrow Such an attitude would emphasize sharply the values of life We should live each day with a gentleness a vigor and a keenness of appreciation which are often lost when time stretches before us in the constant panorama of more days and months and years to come There are those of course who would adopt the Epicurean motto of Eat drink and be merry but most people would be chastened by the certainty of impending death 

In stories the doomed hero is usually saved at the last minute by some stroke of fortune but almost always his sense of values is changed he becomes more appreciative of the meaning of life and its permanent spiritual values It ahs often been noted that those who live or have lived in the shadow of death bring a mellow sweetness to everything they do 

Most of us however take life for granted We know that one day we must die but usually we picture that day as far in the future When we are in buoyant health death is all but unimaginable We seldom think of it The days stretch out in an endless vista So we go about our petty tasks hardly aware of our listless attitude toward life 

The same lethargy I am afraid characterizes the use of all our faculties and senses Only the deaf appreciate hearing only the blind realize the manifold blessings that lie in sight Particularly does this observation apply to those who have lost sight and hearing in adult life But those who have never suffered impairment of sight or hearing seldom make the fullest use of these blessed faculties Their eyes and ears take in all sights and sounds hazily without concentration and with little appreciation It is the same old story of not being grateful for what we have until we lose it of not being conscious of health until we are ill 

I have often thought it would be a blessing if each human being were stricken blind and deaf for a few days at some time during his early adult life Darkness would make him more appreciative of sight silence would tech him the joys of sound 

Now and then I have tested my seeing friends to discover what they see Recently I was visited by a very good friends who had just returned from a long walk in the woods and I asked her what she had observed Nothing in particular  she replied I might have been incredulous had I not been accustomed to such reposes for long ago I became convinced that the seeing see little 

How was it possible I asked myself to walk for an hour through the woods and see nothing worthy of note I who cannot see find hundreds of things to interest me through mere touch I feel the delicate symmetry of a leaf I pass my hands lovingly about the smooth skin of a silver birch or the rough shaggy bark of a pine In the spring I touch the branches of trees hopefully in search of a bud the first sign of awakening Nature after her winters sleep I feel the delightful velvety texture of a flower and discover its remarkable convolutions and something of the miracle of Nature is revealed to me Occasionally if I am very fortunate I place my hand gently on a small tree and feel the happy quiver of a bird in full song I am delighted to have the cool waters of a brook rush thought my open finger To me a lush carpet of pine needles or spongy grass is more welcome than the most luxurious Persian rug To me the page ant of seasons is a thrilling and unending drama the action of which streams through my finger tips 

At times my heart cries out with longing to see all these things If I can get so much pleasure from mere touch how much more beauty must be revealed by sight Yet those who have eyes apparently see little the panorama of color and action which fills the world is taken for granted It is human perhaps to appreciate little that which we have and to long for that which we have not but it is a great pity that in the world of light the gift of sight is used only as a mere conveniences rather than as a means of adding fullness to life 

If I were the president of a university I should establish a compulsory course in How to Use Your Eyes The professor would try to show his pupils how they could add joy to their lives by really seeing what passes unnoticed before them He would try to awake their dormant and sluggish faculties 

Perhaps I can best illustrate by imagining what I should most like to see if I were given the use of my eyes say for just three days And while I am imagining suppose you too set your mind to work on the problem of how you would use your own eyes if you had only three more days to see If with the oncoming darkness of the third night you knew that the sun would never rise for you again how would you spend those three precious intervening days What would you most want to let your gaze rest upon 

I naturally should want most to see the things which have become dear to me through my years of darkness You too would want to let your eyes rest on the things that have become dear to you so that you could take the memory of them with you into the night that loomed before you 

If by some miracle I were granted three seeing days to be followed by a relapse into darkness I should divide the period into three parts 

The First Day 

On the first day I should want to see the people whose kindness and gentleness and companionship have made my life worth living First I should like to gaze long upon the face of my dear teacher Mrs Anne Sullivan Macy who came to me when I was a child and opened the outer world to me I should want not merely to see the outline of her face so that I could cherish it in my memory but to study that face and find in it the living evidence of the sympathetic tenderness and patience with which she accomplished the difficult task of my education I should like to see in her eyes that strength of character which has enabled her to stand firm in the face of difficulties and that compassion for all humanity which she has revealed to me so often 

I do not know what it is to see into the heart of a friend through that Window of the soul the eye I can only see through my finger tips the outline of a face I can detect laughter sorrow and many other obvious emotions I know my friends from the feel of their faces But I cannot really picture their personalities by touch I know their personalities of course through other means through the thoughts they express to me through whatever of their actions are revealed to me But I am denied that deeper understanding of them which I am sure would come through sight of them through watching their reactions to various expressed thoughts and circumstances through noting the immediate and fleeting reactions of their eyes and countenance 

Friends who are near to me I know well because through the months and years they reveal themselves to me in all their phases but of casual friends I have only an incomplete impression an impression gained from a handclasp from spoken words which I take from their lips with my finger tips or which they tap into the palm of my hand 

How much easier how much more satisfying it is for you who can see to grasp quickly the essential qualities of another person by watching the subtleties of expression the quiver of a muscle the flutter of a hand But does it ever occur to you to use your sight to see into the inner nature of a friends or acquaintance Do not most of you seeing people grasp casually the outward features of a face and let it go at that 

For instance can you describe accurately the faces of five good friends some of you can but many cannot As an experiment I have questioned husbands of long standing about the color of their wives eyes and often they express embarrassed confusion and admit that they do not know And incidentally it is a chronic complaint of wives that their husbands do not notice new dresses new hats and changes in household arrangements 

The eyes of seeing persons soon become accustomed to the routine of their surroundings and they actually see only the startling and spectacular But even in viewing the most spectacular sights the eyes are lazy Court records reveal every day how inaccurately eyewitnesses see A given event will be seen in several different ways by as many witnesses Some see more than others but few see everything that is within the range of their vision 

Oh the things that I should see if I had the power of sight for just three days 

The first day would be a busy one I should call to me all my dear friends and look long into their faces imprinting upon my mind the outward evidences of the beauty that is within them I should let my eyes rest too on the face of a baby so that I could catch a vision of the eager innocent beauty which precedes the individuals consciousness of the conflicts which life develops 

And I should like to look into the loyal trusting eyes of my dogs  the grave canny little Scottie Darkie and the stalwart understanding Great Dane Helga whose warm tender  and playful friendships are so comforting to me 

On that busy first day I should also view the small simple things of my home I want to see the warm colors in the rugs under my feet the pictures on the walls the intimate trifles that transform a house into home My eyes would rest respectfully on the books in raised type which I have read but they would be more eagerly interested in the printed books which seeing people can read for during the long night of my life the books I have read and those which have been read to me have built themselves into a great shining lighthouse revealing to me the deepest channels of human life and the human spirit 

In the afternoon of that first seeing day I should take a long walk in the woods and intoxicate my eyes on the beauties of the world of Nature trying desperately to absorb in a few hours the vast splendor which is constantly unfolding itself to those who can see On the way home from my woodland jaunt my path would lie near a farm so that I might see the patient horses ploughing in the field perhaps I should see only a tractor and the serene content of men living close to the soil And I should pray for the glory of a colorful sunset 

When dusk had fallen I should experience the double delight of being able to see by artificial light which the genius of man has created to extend the power of his sight when Nature decrees darkness 

In the night of that first day of sight I should not be able to sleep so full would be my mind of the memories of the day 

The Second Day 

The next day  the second day of sight  I should arise with the dawn and see the thrilling miracle by which night is transformed into day I should behold with awe the magnificent panorama of light with which the sun awakens the sleeping earth 

This day I should devote to a hasty glimpse of the world past and present I should want to see the pageant of mans progress the kaleidoscope of the ages How can so much be compressed into one day Through the museums of course Often I have visited the New York Museum of Natural History to touch with my hands many of the objects there exhibited but I have longed to see with my eyes the condensed history of the earth and its inhabitants displayed there  animals and the races of men pictured in their native environment gigantic carcasses of dinosaurs and mastodons which roamed the earth long before man appeared with his tiny stature and powerful brain to conquer the animal kingdom realistic presentations of the processes of development in animals in man and in the implements which man has used to fashion for himself a secure home on this planet and a thousand and one other aspects of natural history

I wonder how many readers of this article have viewed this panorama of the face of living things as pictured in that inspiring museum Many of course have not had the opportunity but I am sure that many who have had the opportunity have not made use of it there indeed is a place to use your eyes You who see can spend many fruitful days there but I with my imaginary three days of sight could only take a hasty glimpse and pass on 

My next stop would be the Metropolitan Museum of Art for just as the Museum of Natural History reveals the material aspects of the world so does the Metropolitan show the myriad facets of the human spirit Throughout the history of humanity the urge to artistic expression has been almost as powerful as the urge for food shelter and procreation And here  in the vast chambers of the Metropolitan Museum is unfolded before me the spirit of Egypt Greece and Rome as expressed in their art I know well through my hands the sculptured gods and goddesses of the ancient Nileland I have felt copies of Parthenon friezes and I have sensed the rhythmic beauty of charging Athenian warriors Apollos and Venuses and the Winged Victory of Samothrace are friends of my finger tips The gnarled bearded features of Homer are dear to me for he too knew blindness 

My hands have lingered upon the living marble of roman sculpture as well as that of later generations I have passed my hands over a plaster cast of Michelangelos inspiring and heroic Moses I have sensed the power of Rodin I have been awed by the devoted spirit of Gothic wood carving These arts which can be touched have meaning for me but even they were meant to be seen rather than felt and I can only guess at the beauty which remains hidden from me I can admire the simple lines of a Greek vase but its figured decorations are lost to me 

So on this my second day of sight I should try to probe into the soul of man through this art The things I knew through touch I should now see More splendid still the whole magnificent world of painting would be opened to me from the Italian Primitives with their serene religious devotion to the Moderns with their feverish visions I should look deep into the canvases of Raphael Leonardo da Vinci Titian Rembrandt I should want to feast my eyes upon the warm colors of Veronese study the mysteries of E Greco catch a new vision of Nature from Corot Oh there is so much rich meaning and beauty in the art of the ages for you who have eyes to see 

Upon my short visit to this temple of art I should not be able to review a fraction of that great world of art which is open to you I should be able to get only a superficial impression Artists tell me that for deep and true appreciation of art one must educated the eye One must learn through experience to weigh the merits of line of composition of form and color If I had eyes how happily would I embark upon so fascinating a study Yet I am told that to many of you who have eyes to see the world of art is a dark night unexplored and unilluminated 

It would be with extreme reluctance that I should leave the Metropolitan Museum which contains the key to beauty  a beauty so neglected Seeing persons however do not need a metropolitan to find this key to beauty The same key lies waiting in smaller museums and in books on the shelves of even small libraries But naturally in my limited time of imaginary sight I should choose the place where the key unlocks the greatest treasures in the shortest time 

The evening of my second day of sight I should spend at a theatre or at the movies Even now I often attend theatrical performances of all sorts but the action of the play must be spelled into my hand by a companion But how I should like to see with my own eyes the fascinating figure of Hamlet or the gusty Falstaff amid colorful Elizabethan trappings How I should like to follow each movement of the graceful Hamlet each strut of the hearty Falstaff And since I could see only one play I should be confronted by a manyhorned dilemma for there are scores of plays I should want to see You who have eyes can see any you like How many of you I wonder when you gaze at a play a movie or any spectacle realize and give thanks for the miracle of sight which enables you to enjoy its color  grace and movement 

I cannot enjoy the beauty of rhythmic movement except in a sphere restricted to the touch of my hands I can vision only dimly the grace of a Pavlowa although I know something of the delight of rhythm for often I can sense the beat of music as it vibrates through the floor I can well imagine that cadenced motion must be one of the most pleasing sights in the world I have been able to gather something of this by tracing with my fingers the lines in sculptured marble if this static grace can be so lovely how much more acute must be the thrill of seeing grace in motion 

One of my dearest memories is of the time when Joseph Jefferson allowed me to touch his face and hands as he went through some of the gestures and speeches of his beloved Rip Van Winkle I was able to catch thus a meager glimpse of the world of drama and I shall never forget the delight of that moment But oh how much I must miss and how much pleasure you seeing ones can derive from watching and hearing the interplay of speech and movement in the unfolding of a dramatic performance If I could see only one play I should know how to picture in my mind the action of a hundred plays which I have read or had transferred to me through the medium of the manual alphabet 

So through the evening of my second imaginary day of sight the great fingers of dramatic literature would crowd sleep from my eyes 

The Third Day 

The following morning I should again greet the dawn anxious to discover new delights for I am sure that for those who have eyes which really see the dawn of each day must be a perpetually new revelation of beauty 

This according to the terms of my imagined miracle is to be my third and last day of sight I shall have no time to waste in regrets or longings there is too much to see The first day I devoted to my friends animate and inanimate The second revealed to me the history of man and Nature Today I shall spend in the workaday world of the present amid the haunts of men going about the business of life And where can one find so many activities and conditions of men as in New York So the city becomes my destination 

I start from my home in the quiet little suburb of Forest Hills Long Island Here  surrounded by green lawns trees and flowers are neat little houses happy with the voices and movements of wives and children havens of peaceful rest for men who toil in the city I drive across the lacy structure of steel which spans the East River and I get a new and startling vision of the power and ingenuity of the mind of man Busy boasts chug and scurry about the river  racy speed boat stolid snorting tugs If I had long days of sight ahead I should spend many of them watching the delightful activity upon the river 

I look ahead and before me rise the fantastic towers of New York a city that seems to have stepped from the pages of a fairy story What an aweinspiring sight these glittering spires these vast banks of stone and steelstructures such as the gods might build for themselves This animated picture is a part of the lives of millions of people every day How many I wonder give it so much as a seconds glance Very few I fear Their eyes are blind to this magnificent sight because it is so familiar to them 

I hurry to the top of one of those gigantic structures the Empire State Building for there  a short time ago I saw the city below through the eyes of my secretary I am anxious to compare my fancy with reality I am sure I should not be disappointed in the panorama spread out before me for to me it would be a vision of another world 

Now I begin my rounds of the city First I stand at a busy corner merely looking at people trying by sight of them to understand something of their live I see smiles and I am happy I see serious determination and I am proud I see suffering and I am compassionate 

I stroll down Fifth Avenue I throw my eyes out of focus so that I see no particular object but only a seething kaleidoscope of colors I am certain that the colors of womens dresses moving in a throng must be a gorgeous spectacle of which I should never tire But perhaps if I had sight I should be like most other women  too interested in styles and the cut of individual dresses to give much attention to the splendor of color in the mass And I am convinced too that I should become an inveterate window shopper for it must be a delight to the eye to view the myriad articles of beauty on display 

From Fifth Avenue I make a tour of the cityto Park Avenue to the slums to factories to parks where children play I take a stayathome trip abroad by visiting the foreign quarters Always my eyes are open wide to all the sights of both happiness and misery so that I may probe deep and add to my understanding of how people work and live my heart is full of the images of people and things My eye passes lightly over no single trifle it strives to touch and hold closely each thing its gaze rests upon Some sights are pleasant filling the heart with happiness but some are miserably pathetic To these latter I do not shut my eyes for they too are part of life To close the eye on them is to close the heart and mind 

My third day of sight is drawing to an end Perhaps there are many serious pursuits to which I should devote the few remaining hours but I am afraid that on the evening of that last day I should again run away to the theater to a hilariously funny play so that I might appreciate the overtones of comedy in the human spirit 

At midnight my temporary respite from blindness would cease and permanent night would close in on me again Naturally in those three short days I should not have seen all I wanted to see Only when darkness had again descended upon me should I realize how much I had left unseen But my mind would be so crowded with glorious memories that I should have little time for regrets Thereafter the touch of every object would bring a glowing memory of how that object looked 

Perhaps this short outline of how I should spend three days of sight does not agree with the program you would set for yourself if you knew that you were about to be stricken blind I am however sure that if you actually faced that fate your eyes would open to things you had never seen before storing up memories for the long night ahead You would use your eyes as never before Everything you saw would become dear to you Your eyes would touch and embrace every object that came within your range of vision Then at last you would really see and a new world of beauty would open itself before you 

I who am blind can give one hint to those who see  one admonition to those who would make full use of the gift of sight Use your eyes as if tomorrow you would be stricken blind And the same method can be applied to the other senses Hear the music of voices the song of a bird the mighty strains of an orchestra as if you would be stricken deaf tomorrow Touch each object you want to touch as if tomorrow your tactile sense would fail Smell the perfume of flowers taste with relish each morsel as if tomorrow you could never smell and taste again Make the most of every sense glory in all the facets of pleasure and beauty which the world reveals to you through the several means of contact which Nature provides But of all the senses I am sure that sight must be the most delightful
